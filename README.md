# Pomomon Club Standards

The Pomomon Club Standards are an initiative to make Pomomon Farm and potential successors a more alive experience by incoporating things like leaderboards and potentially even more in the future.

This repository contains the website, where all the standards will be published, as well as any additional documentation or guidance we may provide.

Stuff like security will have to be considered to make sure no abuse can happen, therefore we'll likely take roughly until December 1st to publish the first standard. Please be patient and enjoy creating Pomomon Farm in the meantime.

            The Pomomon Club Leaderboard Standard is an API specification that
            allows anyone to implement the Pomomon Farm Playtime Leaderboard in
            their version of the game.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bg-200 text-lg text-justify">
            The standard and implementation is not yet complete and still in
            early stages. Things may change and are not final yet. However, a
            draft of the first version of the standard is available in the
            navigation bar.
